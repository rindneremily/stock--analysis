# Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
This project outlined a list of stocks and their returns, dates, and records. By running this analysis, I could focus on individual stocks and the returns they would present. The ultimate goal of analyzing this data is to learn which stocks to invest in. Focusing on the returns allows for a clear view on where to invest. 

## Results
Running this analysis proved to have some challenges. After learning the concepts, it was difficult to match the concepts with the syntax. Oftentimes, I found myself knowing how to get a solution but not knowing the correct syntax to get there. Shown below, I was able to mark all the returns with the designated color but had trouble reaching the ticker outcome I wanted. After experimentation with the code, I believe my issue came down to a misused variable. However, I was unable to determine exactly how to fix the code.

## Summary
### Refactoring Code in General
Refactoring code in general allows for a simpler outcome. A big advantage is that it makes the code more presentable to a reader. A possible disadvantage is that specific details could get lost. Based on my understanding of refactoring, I may be able to use refactoring to help my data look more presentable but I would be at risk of making unnecessary changes in code. 

### Refactored VBA Script
VBA script seems to be a more unique type of code. Refactoring it can be helpful as there can be many redundancies. As a beginner coder, a large disadvantage is the complexity of refactoring. Though it can be helpful, the original VBA script is more important than the cleanliness of the data. Once I have more experience with the code, I think I could use refactoring entirely to my advantage.
